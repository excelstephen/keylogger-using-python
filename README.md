# keylogger-using-python
This is a basic Keylogger application created using the Pynput package in the Python's library.


Keyloggers keep track of everything typed and record all information. Credit card numbers, passwords, and other private information entered on the keyboard can be intercepted using this technique. Without the user's knowledge, keystroke loggers can be installed as malware to steal private information.

Use the "pip install pynput", to install the Pynput package.

Note: for this application to run, disable Windows anti-virus
